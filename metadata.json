If the action is run, your bot's turn will end immediately, meaning no other blocks will be executed. Snippets are intended to be a simple introduction to Bot Land given that they're typically just a single block, meaning you can set up an entire script using snippets as a sort of priority system. Snippets are currently only available in the block-based editor.",
